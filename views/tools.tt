    <h4>Dark Kinase Expression Data Browser</h4>
	</p>We've developed a <a
	href="https://expression.darkkinome.org" target="_blank">browser</a> for the expression data
collected by the <a href="https://www.gtexportal.org/home/" target="_blank">GTEx consortium</a> and the Human Proteome Map <a href = "http://humanproteomemap.org/index.php">Project</a> 
with a focus on the relative expression of the dark kinases in context with the
entire kinome. This browser displays understudied kinases with especially high
expression in the tissues that have been studied by the GTEx and the HPM consortiums. The
results can be browsed on the basis of specific kinases or organ/tissue systems.

    <h4>Coral: Clear and Customizable Visualization of Human Kinome Data</h4>
    </p>Coral is a user-friendly interactive web application for visualizing both
    quantitative and qualitative data. Unlike previous tools, Coral can encode
    data in three features (node color, node size, and branch color), allows
    three modes of kinome visualization (the traditional kinome tree as well
    as radial and dynamic-force networks) and generates high-resolution
    scalable vector graphic files suitable for publication without the need
    for refinement in graphic editing software. Due to its user-friendly,
    interactive, and highly customizable design, Coral is broadly applicable
    to high-throughput studies of the human kinome.
    </br>
    </p>Coral was developed in collaboration with the <a
       href="http://phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu">Phanstiel lab</a> and is
     available through <a href="https://github.com/dphansti/CORAL">github</a>
     and the <a href="http://phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu/CORAL/">web</a>.

    <h4>The Small Molecule Suite: A Set of Tools to Explore Small Molecule Perturbagens</h4>
    </p>The Small Molecule Suite is a collection of cheminformatics tools that
    allow researchers to get insight in the selectivity and similarity of
    compounds and build custom chemical genetics libraries based on desired
    target coverage and other user-specified criteria. The applications in the
    suite use state-of-the-art quantitative methods such as target affinity
    spectrum similarity and phenotypic fingerprint similarity, which are
    data-driven. The suite updates regularly to keep incorporating the latest
    published data.

    <h4>INDRA</h4>
	</p>INDRA (Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler) is an
	automated model assembly system, originally developed for molecular systems
	biology and currently being generalized to other domains. INDRA draws on
	natural language processing systems and structured databases to collect
	mechanistic and causal assertions, represents them in a standardized form
	(INDRA Statements), and assembles them into various modeling formalisms
	including causal graphs and dynamical models. INDRA also provides knowledge
	assembly procedures that operate on INDRA Statements and correct certain
	errors, find and resolve redundancies, infer missing information, filter to
	a scope of interest and assess belief.

    <h4>IDG Chemical Tools</h4>
	</p> The Kinase Chemogenomic Set (<a href="https://www.sgc-unc.org/kcgs" target = "_blank">KCGS</a>) is a collection of narrow
	spectrum small molecule kinase inhibitors that is available from the
	SGC-UNC. The set contains inhibitors with sub-µM biochemical activity on 39
	dark kinases. Each inhibitor has been cross-screened on hundreds of human
  kinases and demonstrates a selectivity index at 1 µM < 0.05 (number of kinases
  inhibited by 90% divided by the total number of kinases screened). KCGS is
  <a href="https://ximbio.com/reagent/157681/the-kinase-chemogenomic-set-kcgs" target = "_blank">available</a> in aliquots of 1 µL of a 10 mM DMSO solution
	   in 96 well plates.

	   </p>Dark kinase inhibitors that demonstrate IC50 < 1 µM in a live cell NanoBRET
	   assay have been designated as IDG Chemical Tools. A list of the current
	 IDG Chemical Tools can be found <a href="/compounds" target = "_blank">here</a>.

    <h4>IDG Reactome</h4>
	</p>The <a href="https://reactome.org/">Reactome Knowledgebase</a> of Human Biological Pathways and Processes is a curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and distributed by all members of the biological research community. Reactome extends the classic maps of intermediary metabolism by broadening the scope of reactions to include components of signaling, transport and other processes of cell biology. With tools and techniques such as pathway visualization and enrichment analysis, Reactome can be used to reduce large, complex and noisy genome-scale datasets involving thousands of genes to a manageable set of patterns, from which to draw testable hypotheses relating specific processes, their interplay, and their role in generating disease phenotypes. The <a href="https://idg.reactome.org/">Reactome IDG portal</a> is designed to project understudied proteins, including dark kinases, onto the well-known pathway contexts, facilitating to infer potential functional involvement of these proteins within the pathways.

	</p>The Reactome was developed by an international multidisciplinary team from <a href="http://oicr.on.ca/">OICR</a>, <a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/">OHSU</a>, <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL-EBI</a>, and <a href="http://nyulangone.org/">NYULMC</a>.

    <h4>Kinase Inhibitor Cell Viability Predictions - kipred Server</h4>

	</p>The <a href="https://kipred.gomezlab.org">kinase inhibitor cell viability prediction server</a> is a tool that allows any user with an RNAseq data set to make cell viability predictions for a set of about 230 kinase inhibitors. These inhibitors were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan4368">previously characterized</a> using a mass spectroscopy kinobead assay. Using this data, cell viability results associated with each compound from <a href="https://www.theprismlab.org/the-prism-assay">PRISM</a> and other multiomic data from the <a href="https://sites.broadinstitute.org/ccle/">CCLE</a>, we have developed a model that uses RNAseq data to make custom predictions for this set of kinase inhibitors. To make it easier for potential users to access this tool, we have also used the pre-processed RNAseq data available through <a href="https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/">ARCHS4</a> to enable any human GEO data sample to processed without any need for the user to upload their data. The ARCHS submission was made possible through a collaboration with <a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/alexander-lachmann">Alexander Lachmann</a> and <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/avi-maayan">Avi Ma'ayan</a>.</div>
